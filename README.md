Made in Unity using c#

Physics simulator that hosts a singular ball that can be "kicked" with a vector of your choosing.
Drag sliders to change the values, centered at 0 for x, z, and left aligned at 0 for y.
Pressing space allows the ball to be kicked using current values.
You can reset the ball with R, returning it to its original position to fall back to the field.
